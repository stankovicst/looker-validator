# Performance Optimization Strategies

## Optimizing for Large Looker Projects

### SQL Validator Enhancements

```python
# Suggested enhancements for sql_validator.py

def _binary_search_dimensions(self, model: str, explore: str, dimension_names: List[str]):
    """Improved binary search with adaptive chunk sizing"""
    # Base cases remain the same
    if len(dimension_names) <= 1:
        # Process single dimension
        return
        
    # Adaptive chunk sizing based on project size
    if len(dimension_names) > 1000:
        chunk_size = 200  # Smaller chunks for very large projects
    elif len(dimension_names) > 500:
        chunk_size = 100
    else:
        chunk_size = 50
        
    # Process in chunks with exponential backoff on failures
    # ...
```

### Parallel Processing Configuration

For extremely large projects, adjust these settings in your config:

```yaml
# Performance tuning for large projects
concurrency: 5           # Lower concurrency to avoid API rate limits
chunk_size: 200          # Smaller chunks to prevent timeouts
timeout: 1800            # Longer timeout (30 minutes)
max_retries: 3           # More retries with exponential backoff
```

### Memory Optimization

For projects with thousands of dimensions:

1. Add streaming results processing:
```python
def _process_large_response(self, response_generator):
    """Process streaming results to conserve memory"""
    for chunk in response_generator:
        # Process chunk without keeping full response in memory
        yield self._process_chunk(chunk)
```

2. Implement garbage collection for long-running validations:
```python
import gc

def _cleanup_between_tests(self):
    """Force garbage collection between major operations"""
    gc.collect()
```

### Selective Validation

For incremental processing, enhance the change detection:

```python
def _get_changed_explores(self, explores: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """More efficient change detection with Git diff"""
    # Use git diff to detect only changed files
    # Filter explores based on changed LookML files
    # Return only explores affected by changed dimensions
```

### Caching Strategy

Implement result caching for repeated validations:

```python
def _save_validation_cache(self, model, explore, result):
    """Cache validation results by hash"""
    cache_key = self._generate_cache_key(model, explore)
    cache_file = os.path.join(self.cache_dir, f"{cache_key}.json")
    with open(cache_file, "w") as f:
        json.dump(result, f)

def _check_validation_cache(self, model, explore):
    """Check for cached results"""
    cache_key = self._generate_cache_key(model, explore)
    cache_file = os.path.join(self.cache_dir, f"{cache_key}.json")
    if os.path.exists(cache_file):
        with open(cache_file, "r") as f:
            return json.load(f)
    return None
```
